Start by mounting the Power Supply Circuit Board to the Power Supply. You'll see that the circuit board has fingers that will extend into terminals on the power supply. Hold the circuit board up to the power supply to see which terminals you'll be using. Remove the screws from each of these terminals and place the power supply circuit board in them. Put the screws back into the terminals through the circuit board and tighten them firmly.

Next you'll mount the gShield Enclosure to the Power Supply Interface. You'll put two M5  x 10mm screws into the holes of the gShield Enclosure through the corresponding holes in the Power Supply Interface. Secure them from the inside of the Power Supply Interface with nylock nuts.

<div class="row image-row"> !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/699/original/1016.jpg?1424471663! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/700/original/1017.jpg?1424471664! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/701/original/1020.jpg?1424471665! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/702/original/1024.jpg?1424471666!

The Power Supply Interface attaches to the Power Supply with four phillips head screws. Slide the interface onto the power supply making sure to push the green terminal blocks through their respective holes. Thread the screws through the interface and into the power supply by hand and then use your wrench to tighten them a little more.

<h3 id="strip-stepper-cable">3. Strip the Stepper Cable</h3>

Now for some wiring. Strip about two inches from the end of one piece of stepper cable. You'll notice that underneath the grey jacket of the stepper cable are foil wrapping, string, a thin raw wire and four colored wires (black, green, white and red). Remove everything except the four colored wires.

<div class="row image-row">!(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/703/original/1060.jpg?1424471789! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/704/original/1061.jpg?1424471790! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/705/original/1062.jpg?1424471792! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/706/original/1063.jpg?1424471793!

Strip the ends of the four wires about one quarter of an inch.

<h3 id="determine-axes">4. Determine the Axes</h3>

Now twist the copper from the black and green wires together. This will make the stepper motor that the cable is attached to resist movement.

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/712/original/1069.jpg?1424475157!

Gently push the X-Axis of your machine in one direction, if the motor feels like it's resisting your efforts you've identified that piece of stepper cable as "X."

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/713/original/1072.jpg?1424475158!

If you don't feel resistance try moving the Y and Z axes until you find the motor that is resisting movement. If you're unsure whether or not you're encountering resistance try untwisting the green and black wires and comparing resistance.

Place the pins into the gShield making sure that the black plastic touches the top of the board. Solder each pin individually making sure to not "bridge" the pins by soldering them together. You may find it easier to solder the pins if you support them with a small object.

<h3 id="wire-stepper-cable">6. Wire the Stepper Cable to the gShield</h3>

Once you've determined which stepper cable belongs to which axis you can wire them into the gShield. First loosen all of the screws on the gShield (they will jump a thread when they are fully loose, but they won't come out of the terminal blocks.)

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/717/original/1082.jpg?1424475163!

The gShield is marked "X," "Y," and "Z." Wire the stepper cable according to the markings on the shield and order your wires (from left to right) %{color:black}**black**%, %{color:green}**green**%, **white**,  %{color:red}**red**%.

Push the USB port through the square hole on the gShield enclosure and line up the screws with the threaded inserts on the gShield Enclosure. Screw the Arduino down to the enclosure remembering to alternate screws as you tighten to keep the board even. There's no reason to go past finger tight with these.

Insert the crimped pins into the header connector as shown. They should click when they are in far enough and you should be able to pull gently on the wire without the pins coming out. Strip the other end of the black and yellow stranded wire. Insert them into the small green terminal block and press it into the Power Supply Interface.

Note: If using the 48vdc spindle or other DC motor with a different power supply, the easiest setup is to buy another PCB cover for the power supply. Then the black and yellow wires as well as the spindle power and ground will go to the other power supply(48vdc).

Now is a good time to add the "actuators" for the limit switches. Start with the X-Axis limit switch actuator. Push the post assembly insertion nut into the rear piece of X-Axis Makerslide. Screw the M5 screw into the insertion nut. Adjust the placement of the insertion nut by loosening the screw and sliding it left and right. When the actuator is in the right place you'll be able to activate the switch (you'll hear a gentle click) without the X Carriage contacting the smooth idlers on the left Y-Plate.
